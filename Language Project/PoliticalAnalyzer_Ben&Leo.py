# Have fun!

### Ideas for the project in the beginning

### matplotlib make charts for evidence for Rebpulican or Democrat

### find "republicans" for democrats key words: the initial idea

# focus on 3 main functions/programs
# one function finds democrats or republicans,
# key words "great" trump indicator
## republcians will say democrats more than republicans
